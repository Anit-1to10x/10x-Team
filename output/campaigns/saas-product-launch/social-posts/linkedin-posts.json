I personally reached out.\nDay 3: Discovered they were frustrated with our new UI\nDay 4: Rolled back their account to the old UI\nDay 5: They renewed for 2 more years\n\nTotal time from alert to save: 72 hours\n\nWithout automated alerts? They would've churned silently.\n\nThis is why we built FlowMetrics.\n\nWhat's your system for catching at-risk customers?\n\n#CustomerSuccess #SaaS #ChurnPrevention #StartupStory"
