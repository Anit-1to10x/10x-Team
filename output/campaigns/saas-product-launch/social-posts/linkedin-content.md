## Post 1 - Problem Awareness

**Content:**

8% of your users will churn this month.

But here's the thing - most of them showed warning signs 2 weeks ago.

The signs:
- Login frequency dropped 40%
- Feature usage went from daily to weekly
- Support tickets increased

The problem? Most founders only see this in hindsight.

What if you could see it happening in real-time?

That's why we built FlowMetrics - automatic churn prediction for SaaS teams.

No data team needed. No complex setup. Just answers.

## Post 3 - Story

**Content:**

Last month, we almost lost a $50K/year customer.

Here's what happened (and how we caught it):

Day 1: Their engagement score dropped 23%
Day 2: Our alert fired. I personally reached out.
Day 3: Discovered they were frustrated with our new UI
Day 4: Rolled back their account to the old UI
Day 5: They renewed for 2 more years

Total time from alert to save: 72 hours

Without automated alerts? They would've churned silently.

This is why we built FlowMetrics.

What's your system for catching at-risk customers?
