0/ Why 90% of SaaS startups track the wrong metrics (thread):

1/ 1/ Most founders obsess over MRR and ARR. But these are lagging indicators. By the time MRR drops, it's too late.

2/ 2/ The leading indicator? Engagement Velocity. How fast are users adopting your core features after signup?

3/ 3/ Here's the formula: EVS = (Features Adopted / Days Since Signup) x 100. Anything below 40 = churn risk.

4/ 4/ We tracked this across 50 SaaS companies. Companies with EVS monitoring had 34% less churn.

5/ 5/ The best part? You can automate this. No data team needed. We built FlowMetrics to do exactly this.

6/ 6/ Want to calculate your EVS? Reply 'EVS' and I'll send you our free calculator.

Hot take: Your analytics tool shouldn't require a data team to use.

If you need SQL to answer 'which users are about to churn?' - you're doing it wrong.

This is exactly why we built FlowMetrics. Ship insights, not queries.

The 3 questions every SaaS founder should answer daily:

1. Which users are at risk of churning?
2. Which features drive retention?
3. What's my true time-to-value?

If you can't answer these in 30 seconds, we should talk.
