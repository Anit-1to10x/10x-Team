Saw {{company_name}} hit #3 - impressive traction.\n\nQuick question: how are you tracking which features drive retention vs. which ones users ignore?\n\nI ask because we built FlowMetrics specifically for growing SaaS teams who need answers fast - without hiring a data team.\n\nWould you be open to a 15-min call to see if it's a fit?\n\nEither way, cheers to the launch momentum!\n\nBest,\nSarah\nFlowMetrics",

Feature Adoption Rate (not just signups)\n2. Time-to-Value (how fast users hit \"aha\")\n3. Engagement Velocity (predicts churn 2 weeks early)\n\nMost tools make this hard. We make it automatic.\n\nWorth a 15-min look?\n\nBest,\nSarah",
