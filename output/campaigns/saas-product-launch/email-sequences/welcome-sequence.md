## Email 2 - Day 2

**Subject:** The #1 metric most SaaS founders ignore (and why it's costing you)

**Preview:** It's not MRR, ARR, or even churn rate...

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Most founders obsess over MRR. But there's a metric that predicts churn 2 weeks before it happens.

It's called the Engagement Velocity Score (EVS).

EVS measures how quickly users adopt core features after signup. A dropping EVS means trouble - even if your MRR looks healthy.

FlowMetrics calculates your EVS automatically. No manual tracking needed.

Here's what one of our users found:
"We identified 23 at-risk accounts last month. Reached out personally and saved $47K in ARR." - Mike, Founder of DataSync

Your EVS dashboard is waiting: [link]

Best,
Sarah

## Email 3 - Day 4

**Subject:** How DataSync saved $47K in ARR using FlowMetrics

**Preview:** Real results from a team just like yours

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Remember Mike from DataSync I mentioned?

Here's exactly what happened:

Before FlowMetrics:
- 8% monthly churn
- No early warning system
- Reactive customer success

After 30 days with FlowMetrics:
- Identified 23 at-risk accounts (automatically)
- Saved 19 of them with proactive outreach
- Reduced churn to 5.2%

The math: 19 accounts x $2,500 avg contract = $47,500 saved

Want similar results? Here's what Mike did:
1. Set up churn risk alerts (10 min)
2. Created a "save playbook" for his CS team
3. Reached out within 24 hours of each alert

Best,
Sarah

P.S. I'd love to feature your success story next. What metric matters most to you?
