    "body": "Hi {{first_name}},\n\nMost founders obsess over MRR. But there's a metric that predicts churn 2 weeks before it happens.\n\nIt's called the Engagement Velocity Score (EVS).\n\nEVS measures how quickly users adopt core features after signup. A dropping EVS means trouble - even if your MRR looks healthy.\n\nFlowMetrics calculates your EVS automatically. No manual tracking needed.\n\nHere's what one of our users found:\n\"We identified 23 at-risk accounts last month. Reached out personally and saved $47K in ARR.\" - Mike, Founder of DataSync\n\nYour EVS dashboard is waiting: [link]\n\nBest,\nSarah\n\nP.S. Want me to walk you through your EVS?
